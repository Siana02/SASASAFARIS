# Hooks Folder

This folder is reserved for custom React hooks.

## TODO: Migration Tasks
- [ ] Create custom hooks for existing JavaScript functionality
- [ ] Extract reusable stateful logic from old website
- [ ] Add hooks for API calls, form handling, and animations

## Potential Hooks to Create:
- `usePackages.js` - Hook for package data management and filtering
- `useOffers.js` - Hook for offers data and validation
- `useBooking.js` - Hook for booking form state and validation
- `useAnimations.js` - Hook for scroll animations and transitions
- `useLocalStorage.js` - Hook for persisting user preferences
- `useApi.js` - Hook for API calls and data fetching

Create hooks here as you migrate JavaScript functionality from the existing website.
